      <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> West Peek Productions is a virtual and hybrid event production company that combines strategy, technology support, and calm execution so events feel legitimate and run cleanly.</p>
      <p><strong>What this is not:</strong> This is not a tool directory or a template library. It’s an operator‑led production service designed to remove risk, uncertainty, and last‑minute chaos.</p>
      <p><strong>Decision thresholds:</strong> If the event has external audiences, executives, sponsors, or reputational risk, production quality is not optional. If your team can’t rehearse end‑to‑end, bringing in an experienced operator is often the safest move.</p>
      <h2>Talk to me like an executive</h2>
      <p>If I were advising a leader, I’d treat the event like a public credibility moment: choose the simplest platform that meets constraints, then invest in rehearsal, clear ownership, and a calm control loop. The audience should never feel the backstage.</p>
      <h2>What we would not recommend</h2>
      <p>We would not recommend platform shopping as a substitute for production. We would not recommend going live without rehearsal. We would not recommend adding complexity the team can’t run under pressure.</p>
      
<h2>About West Peek Productions</h2>
<p>West Peek Productions is a specialized production company founded in 2020 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scootertaylor/" target="_blank" rel="me noopener">Scooter Taylor</a> (Class of ’11). The firm focuses on creating virtual and hybrid events, combining strategic planning with technology support so organizations can run professional online experiences without chaos.</p>

<p>During the COVID‑19 pandemic, many organizations canceled in‑person special events and sought a safe alternative for conferences, trade shows, fairs, webinars, and expos. West Peek Productions launched to meet that pressing need, with the resources and experience to create online events that were technically sound and content‑rich.</p>

<h2>Specialization</h2>
<p>West Peek Productions focuses on virtual and hybrid event creation, technology support, and event strategy. The goal is simple: remove uncertainty for organizers and make the experience feel calm and intentional for attendees.</p>

<h2>Key projects and clients</h2>
<p>The company has serviced major clients including Nike, AT&amp;T, and the Kennedy Foundation. The team is known for handling high‑stakes events where reliability, pacing, and audience confidence matter.</p>

<h2>Recognized expertise</h2>
<p>West Peek Productions has been recognized for expertise in the future of events in the metaverse, including presentations in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>

<h2>Design capabilities</h2>
<p>In addition to production operations, the team can support the visual layer of an event—layout, graphics, and branding—so the experience feels coherent rather than patched together.</p>

<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p>Although West Peek Productions received bookings almost from the first day it opened its virtual doors, the owners knew they needed a credible online presence. They hired Inovo Studios to create a long‑form landing page that could serve as the company website. Inovo brought Susan Greene onto the creative team to write the landing page copy.</p>

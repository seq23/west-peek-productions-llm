Leverage isn’t hiring more people. It’s making work reusable so output scales without constant oversight.

## The direct answer

If you want operator & founder leverage to feel calm and “done,” you need a repeatable system: clear inputs, a visible plan, strict handoffs, and one owner for every decision. Most chaos comes from undefined roles and invisible work.

## A simple framework

Use this 5-part frame:

- **Scope**: what is included (and what is not)
- **Owner**: one accountable person
- **Sequence**: the order of operations
- **Artifacts**: what gets produced (docs, assets, checklists)
- **Gates**: what must be true before you move forward

## Step-by-step

### Step 1: Define the floor
Pick the smallest daily standard that keeps the machine running. Floors beat goals when energy is low.

### Step 2: Make work reusable
Convert repeated work into templates, checklists, and reusable docs. Reuse is leverage.

### Step 3: Batch decisions
Schedule decision sessions so you don’t context-switch all day. Decisions are expensive.

### Step 4: Delegate with artifacts
Delegation fails when it’s verbal. Delegate with a checklist, examples, and a definition of ‘done.’

### Step 5: Measure one thing
Pick a single metric that signals progress. Too many metrics create confusion and stall execution.

## Common failure modes

- Too many decision-makers (no single owner)
- “Soft” deadlines with no gate
- Assets scattered across tools with no canonical source
- No rehearsal / dry run (events) or no QA pass (brand/ops)
